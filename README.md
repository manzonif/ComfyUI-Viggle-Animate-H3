# ComfyUI-Viggle-Animate-H3

**[English](README.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)**

<br>

ComfyUI nodes for **[Viggle-Animate](https://huggingface.co/Viggle/Viggle-Animate)** — a 33.1 B full finetune of MiniMax-H3's `ref2va` transformer for **character replacement in video**: it takes a driving video and a reference still, and re-renders the performer(s) in the clip as the character in the still. Motion, camera, timing, background and lighting come from the video; identity comes from the image.

No text encoder, no prompt: conditioning is one frozen 362-token embedding computed once by the Viggle team with Qwen3-VL (`assets/fixed_prompt.txt`), identical for every render.

The sampler is DMD2-distilled and works with very low step counts. **The upstream baseline is 4 sigma points: 3 Euler updates.** The included workflows also contain **manual sigma schedules derived from the upstream sampling formula**, allowing the distilled schedule to be reproduced directly with ComfyUI's existing **ManualSigmas** node.

For these manual presets with Euler and BasicGuider / CFG 1.0, **4 sigma points = 3 sampling updates / model forward passes**, **6 points = 5**, and **8 points = 7**. The final `0.0` is included in the point count. For ComfyUI and the converted/quantized models, choose **4 points for speed, 6 for balance, or 8 for quality (may over-sharpen)**.

## New in 1.3.3

- **Lip-sync from the driving clip.** **Viggle-Animate Conditioning (H3, Windowed)** takes optional `audio`, `audio_vae` and `fps` inputs. Connect the driving clip's own soundtrack and the MiniMax-H3 **audio** VAE: the clip is encoded once and its latent is *held clean* in the target audio rows for every denoise step, so the mouth follows the real track instead of the model inventing one to be thrown away.
- **Viggle Chunked Sampler** gained a third output, `audio_latent` — the assembled AV audio track (a plain `LATENT`, decodable with core **VAE Decode (Audio)**). The `chunk_map` says whether the audio is conditioned or generated.
- Chunk caches and loop checkpoint keys now include a fingerprint of the encoded soundtrack, so swapping the audio never replays a chunk rendered against a different one.
- Leave `audio` empty for the previous behaviour: silent audio rows, a generated track, discard at save time.

## New in 1.3.2

- Fix final-window motion-reference length mismatches for off-grid source lengths. The final reference is padded before VAE encoding to match the target latent count; this resolved the reported ending drift in the maintainer's 289-frame test.
- Restore full-size, end-aligned final windows while preserving the source ending.
- Add `five_frame_anchor` continuation (default), using five decoded/re-encoded frames and preserving already accepted output. Select `latent_overlap` to compare with the previous method.
- The Chunked Sampler trims decoded grid padding to the loaded source frame count. The advanced loop still returns latents; its external decode includes grid padding.
- Update example workflows and checkpoint handling. Restart ComfyUI and refresh the browser. Older loop workflows need the H3 VAE connected to **Sample Chunk** for anchor mode. Code changes invalidate automatic checkpoint reuse; existing files remain readable.

## New in 1.3.0

Added windowed conditioning and the **Viggle Chunked Sampler** for longer clips, with latent carry, chunk reuse and seed overrides for another take. Added **4-, 6- and 8-point custom sigma presets**, derived from the upstream shift-3 formula: **fast, balanced, and quality-focused (may over-sharpen)**, respectively.

## Nodes

The node pack includes four loop nodes for disk checkpoints, external VAE
decoding and live chunk progress. See [the long-generation guide](docs/long_video_guide.md)
for wiring, recovery and a first-run checklist.

| Node | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Load Text Conditioning (Viggle)** | Dropdown loader for frozen text conditioning in `models/text_cond/` |
| **Viggle-Animate Conditioning (H3)** | Builds conditioning + AV latent: video-first reference order, both references nested on the canvas short edge (the driving clip's, unless width/height are overridden) — the layout the finetune was trained with |
| **Viggle-Animate Conditioning (H3, Windowed)** | Splits the driving clip into overlapping windows and builds each chunk's references; optionally encodes the driving soundtrack as clean target audio; outputs `cond_set` for the chunked sampler and `guider_positive` for the guider |
| **Viggle Chunked Sampler** | Samples each window, preserves overlap from the preceding chunk, reuses eligible cached chunks, and decodes the assembled video; outputs `frames`, a readable `chunk_map` and the assembled `audio_latent` |
| **Viggle Chunk Loop Start** | Creates the run folder and starts the automatically sized chunk loop; leave `initial_state` disconnected |
| **Viggle Sample Chunk** | Samples/checkpoints one chunk; outputs LATENT, loop state, save filename prefix; shows live progress |
| **Viggle Chunk Loop End** | Waits for chunk decoding and any connected save dependency, then advances the loop |
| **Viggle Assemble Chunk Latents** | Loads one saved chunk or assembles the matching chain for final VAE decoding; reports complete/partial status |

Model loading and sampling controls use ComfyUI core: **Load Diffusion Model**, **Load LoRA (Model Only)**,
**ModelSamplingMiniMaxH3** (video/audio shifts 3.0), **BasicGuider**, **KSamplerSelect** and **ManualSigmas**.
KJNodes **CustomSigmas** can supply the same schedules below. **Viggle Chunked Sampler** decodes internally; connect its `frames` directly to your video-saving node. **Viggle Sample Chunk** outputs LATENT and needs an external VAE Decode.

### Which workflow should I use?

Download a JSON workflow or drag its PNG into ComfyUI:

| Workflow | JSON | PNG |
|---|---|---|
| Single shot (v1.2.0) | [JSON](example_workflows/viggle-animate-h3_workflow-v1.2.0.json) | [PNG](example_workflows/viggle-animate-h3_workflow-v1.2.0.png) |
| Chunked Sampler — memory cache, one final decode | [JSON](example_workflows/viggle-animate-h3_workflow-chunked-sampler.json) | [PNG](example_workflows/viggle-animate-h3_workflow-chunked-sampler.png) |
| Long Video Advanced — loop, disk checkpoints, external decode | [JSON](example_workflows/viggle-animate-h3_workflow-long-video-advanced.json) | [PNG](example_workflows/viggle-animate-h3_workflow-long-video-advanced.png) |

| Your goal | Use |
|---|---|
| One shot, typically 124 frames (~5.2 s at 24 fps) | Original **Viggle-Animate Conditioning (H3)** → core sampler → VAE Decode → save |
| Longer clip with a compact workflow and one final decode | **Windowed Conditioning → Viggle Chunked Sampler**; reuse is memory-only |
| Longer/expensive run, per-chunk previews, or recovery after cancellation/restart | **Windowed Conditioning → Start / Sample Chunk / End → Assemble → VAE Decode**; checkpoints are on disk |

Use the loop workflow when losing a run would be costly, even for two chunks.
You only place one Sample Chunk node: the plan determines how often it repeats.
Start with **124-frame windows, 22-frame overlap, 24 fps** and the four-point
sigma baseline below. [Long-generation setup and troubleshooting](docs/long_video_guide.md).

## Workflow Notes

- Custom nodes required: [ComfyUI-Viggle-Animate-H3](https://github.com/Saganaki22/ComfyUI-Viggle-Animate-H3) (Viggle Animate Conditioning + Load Text Conditioning) and [ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes) (fast preview).
- **Load Video**: use `force_rate = 24`. Single-shot `length` is a maximum: leave it at 124 and a 56-frame input automatically generates 56 frames. Off-grid inputs round up to the next `17k+5` length without discarding reference frames. For windowed conditioning, load the desired full clip (`frame_load_cap = 0` in VHS loads all frames).
- Output resolution follows the driving video by default; set the conditioning node's `width`/`height` to override (each axis rounds to 32), or pre-scale the clip with **Scale Image to Total Pixels**. Tested canvas range: **0.4–1.2 MP** — 1.2 MP holds up reliably, but the driving video and reference image then need to be high quality, not pixelated.
- Choose **4 points / 3 updates for speed**, **6 points / 5 updates for balance**, or **8 points / 7 updates for quality (may over-sharpen)**. Compare results with your chosen ComfyUI model and quantization.
- Tested samplers/schedulers include `euler`, `er_sde`, `exp_heun_2_x0`, `lcm` / `simple`, `normal`, `beta`, and `bong_tangent`, with CFG `1.0` and **ModelSamplingMiniMaxH3** shift `3.0`.
- The included workflows carry both ordinary scheduler configurations and the manual sigma schedules derived from the upstream formula (built in via KJNodes **CustomSigmas**).
- **Upstream sampling baseline:** use **ManualSigmas** with `1.0, 0.8571428571428571, 0.6, 0.0`, **euler**, **BasicGuider** (or CFG 1.0), and the original `viggle_animate_dmd_lora.safetensors` at strength 1.0. Connect ManualSigmas to SamplerCustomAdvanced's or Viggle Chunked Sampler's `sigmas` input. These are four sigma points and **three model evaluations**, matching upstream's “4 steps.” Keep **ModelSamplingMiniMaxH3** at video **3.0**, audio **3.0**; it does not shift the supplied ManualSigmas tensor again. Do not add a separate sigma-transform node afterward.
- Other samplers/schedulers and the rank-64 adapter are experimental alternatives. The bundled example's LCM/bong_tangent eight-step settings differ from the upstream baseline.
- **KJNodes CustomSigmas:** for the four values above, set `interpolate_to_steps` to **3**. Setting it to 4 interpolates through `log(0)` and produces a schedule ending in `0, 0`; Euler returns NaNs, which turn the final video black and contaminate subsequent chunks. The chunked sampler rejects this invalid schedule before rendering.
- Stacks with **Comfy Kitchen** and **block sparse attention** patches.

## Custom sigma presets (4, 6 or 8 points)

Paste one list into **ManualSigmas** or KJNodes **CustomSigmas**, then connect its `SIGMAS` output to the sampler. These presets use `sigma = 3*t / (1 + 2*t)` with evenly spaced `t` from 1 to 0. The four-point preset matches the upstream baseline; the six- and eight-point presets extend the same pattern.

| Suggested workflow title | Sigma points, including final zero | Sampling updates / KJNodes `interpolate_to_steps` |
|---|---|---|
| **Viggle DMD — 3 Steps (Upstream “4-Step”)** | 4 | **3** |
| **Viggle — 5 Steps (6 Sigma Points)** | 6 | **5** |
| **Viggle — 7 Steps (8 Sigma Points)** | 8 | **7** |

**4 points / 3 Euler updates — fast:**

```text
1.0, 0.8571428571428571, 0.6, 0.0
```

**6 points / 5 Euler updates — balanced:**

```text
1.0, 0.9230769230769231, 0.8181818181818182, 0.6666666666666666, 0.42857142857142855, 0.0
```

**8 points / 7 Euler updates — quality (may over-sharpen):**

```text
1.0, 0.9473684210526315, 0.8823529411764706, 0.8, 0.6923076923076923, 0.5454545454545454, 0.3333333333333333, 0.0
```

Keep **Euler**, **BasicGuider / CFG 1.0**, and model shifts **3.0 / 3.0**. The final `0.0` is required: it is the destination of the last update, not another model evaluation. Do not append another zero or shift these lists again. Choose **4 points for speed, 6 for balance, or 8 for quality (may over-sharpen)**. These are practical ComfyUI preset choices; results depend on the clip and model/quantization. Encoding and final decoding still take time regardless of the preset.

## Long video generation

Example workflow (Windowed Conditioning + Chunked Sampler): [example_workflows/viggle-animate-h3_workflow-chunked-sampler.json](example_workflows/viggle-animate-h3_workflow-chunked-sampler.json).

Connect **Viggle-Animate Conditioning (H3, Windowed)** to **Viggle Chunked Sampler**. Its `guider_positive` output supplies BasicGuider's conditioning (or CFGGuider's positive). Start with 124-frame chunks and `continuation = five_frame_anchor` (the default). Each continuation decodes the preceding chunk, selects five frames at the next window start, and re-encodes them into two pinned H3 latents. Normal windows advance 119 frames. Only new positions are accepted into the final latent; extra overlap in the end-aligned final window cannot overwrite earlier output. `latent_overlap` restores the previous method and uses `overlap_frames` for comparison. Motion and appearance can still change at joins; use a repainted reference frame from the driving shot and keep the input/output at 24 fps.

Windowed conditioning reuses complete 17-frame encoder blocks from the preceding window when using the standard ComfyUI H3 VAE. Each window's padded tail is still encoded separately. This reduces repeated VAE work without reducing resolution, changing precision or enlarging the encoding window; custom VAE wrappers retain the full-window path. The log reports how many blocks were reused. Higher resolution and longer clips still cost more to encode.

### Chunk seed controls

| Control | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `seed` | Base sampling seed: chunk 1 uses `seed`, chunk 2 uses `seed + 1`, and so on. Both Viggle samplers generate standard noise internally; remove old noise connections when updating a workflow. |
| `rerender_chunk` | **1-based** chunk whose seed you want to override. **0 disables the override**. Choose a chunk number shown in `chunk_map`. |
| `rerender_seed` | Replacement seed for the selected chunk only. It has no effect when `rerender_chunk = 0`; zero itself is a valid seed. |

These controls let you try another take from a troublesome chunk without changing the base seed for the whole clip. For example, with base `seed = 58`, four chunks normally use `58, 59, 60, 61`. Set `rerender_chunk = 2` and `rerender_seed = 123` to use `58, 123, 60, 61`. Chunk 1 can be reused; chunks 2–4 must be regenerated when that override changes, because each receives content from its predecessor. Their original numeric seeds do not make later chunks independent of the changed carry.

Keep the same override to retain that take, or change `rerender_seed` for another. This is a seed override, not a force-refresh button: unchanged settings can reuse cached results. Setting `rerender_chunk` back to 0 restores the base-seed sequence. The `chunk_map` output shows frame ranges, seeds, overlap and `[cached]` / `[rendered]` labels.

### Chaining and rerender limitations

- You cannot change one chunk and keep all later chunks fixed: the overlap is carried forward. The continuation anchor (or full overlap in `latent_overlap` mode) stays pinned, so rerendering a chunk does not repaint its inherited beginning.
- Reuse is an in-memory optimization, not a saved checkpoint or resume system. Restarting ComfyUI clears it. Cache eviction, changed inputs/model/sampling settings, or oversized entries can require earlier chunks to render again.
- Stock guider objects with inspectable sampler/model settings support reuse. Opaque custom options, callbacks or patches bypass caching and still sample normally; patched workflows may rerender every chunk.
- Chunk caching preserves output precision and is limited to **2 GiB** of CPU tensor storage. Encoded references have a separate **256 MiB / 64-entry** limit. Oversized entries are not cached.
- The assembled latent is decoded again after sampling, even when earlier chunks are reused. Full-clip conditioning, the master latent, final decoding and output frames still need memory; chunking does not make arbitrarily long clips fit in RAM/VRAM.
- Motion, identity and lighting can still change at joins; overlap does not guarantee seamless or stutter-free video. `chunk_frames` is the window length (short clips use a single smaller window). The final window shifts backwards to stay full length, increasing its overlap. All loaded reference frames are used; off-grid lengths generate up to **16 extra frames** to reach the next `17k+5` boundary (minimum 5). The Chunked Sampler trims only grid padding after final decode, returning exactly the loaded source frame count. The loop workflow outputs assembled latents, so its external decode still includes grid padding.

With `five_frame_anchor`, 322 source frames generate 328 internally with windows
**0–123, 119–242, 204–327**, then trim to 322 output frames. Anchoring adds VAE work between chunks.

With `latent_overlap`, 362 input frames, `chunk_frames = 124` and `overlap_frames = 22`, the windows
are **0–123, 102–225, 204–327, 238–361**; all windows render **124 frames**.
A 361-frame input also targets 362 generated frames rather than dropping to 345.
The final reference repeats its last frame only to fill the generation grid before
VAE encoding, keeping reference and target latent counts aligned. The H3 VAE also applies its internal temporal padding;
this does not duplicate the rendered output. Frame counts refer to the actual images
received from the loader, which may differ from source-video metadata after FPS conversion.
- **Lip-sync (optional):** connect the driving clip's soundtrack to Windowed Conditioning's `audio` and the MiniMax-H3 audio VAE to `audio_vae`. The soundtrack is held clean in the target audio rows for the whole denoise — the H3 authors' recipe for lip-sync — so the mouth tracks the speech instead of the model guessing a track. Set `fps` only when the clip was not loaded at 24 fps: the render is always 24 fps, so `fps` maps the audio onto the render timeline (a 30 fps clip keeps its audio and frames together).
- Otherwise the audio rows are generated and discarded: connect the driving clip's audio to the video-saving node and match it to the retained video length; use **24 fps** for input and output. The sampler's `audio_latent` output is the assembled AV audio latent (conditioned, or generated when `audio` is empty) and decodes with core **VAE Decode (Audio)**.
- Invalid sigma schedules and NaN/Inf chunk latents now stop with an actionable error before corrupt output is cached or carried into later chunks.

### Chunk loop nodes

Full node-by-node breakdown (sockets, slot order, resume rules, typical session): [docs/long_video_guide.md](docs/long_video_guide.md). Tested example workflow: [example_workflows/viggle-animate-h3_workflow-long-video-advanced.json](example_workflows/viggle-animate-h3_workflow-long-video-advanced.json).

Four nodes turn the same windowed conditioning into a **graph-expanded loop** with disk checkpoints, so each chunk is decoded and saved through your own nodes while it is produced — a failure mid-run keeps every completed chunk. Connect the H3 VAE to **Sample Chunk** for five-frame anchors (already wired in the updated example):

| Node | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Viggle Chunk Loop Start** | Reads the plan from `cond_set`, picks the checkpoint directory, initializes the loop state. |
| **Viggle Sample Chunk** | Samples the current window only. Outputs the chunk's video LATENT for an ordinary VAE Decode, plus the carried state. Checkpoints the latent to disk **before** returning. |
| **Viggle Chunk Loop End** | Waits for this iteration's decode/save branch, then either expands the next chunk or returns the finished collection. |
| **Viggle Assemble Chunk Latents** | Stitches the saved chunks (trimming overlap) into one LATENT for a single final decode. `chunk_number > 0` loads one chunk for inspection; interrupted runs assemble partially. |

```text
Loop Start ─ loop ───────────────────────────────┐
     └ state → Sample Chunk → LATENT → VAE Decode ─┬→ Loop End (images)
                                                   └→ Video Combine → filenames ↗ (after_save)
```

- **The decode/save branch must feed Loop End** — connect VAE Decode's images to `images` and Video Combine's `filenames` output to `after_save`, so a chunk cannot start before the previous one is decoded and saved. (Core SaveWEBM also works: its `images` output goes straight into `images`.)
- Checkpoints land in `output/viggle_chunks/<run_name>/` as safetensors plus a `manifest.json`; writes are atomic, so a crash never leaves a half-valid chunk.
- With `resume` on, re-running the queue restores every chunk whose **graph, models, conditioning, sigmas and per-chunk seed** still match (the checkpoint filename embeds that fingerprint). Changed settings sample new files under new names; old takes stay on disk. `rerender_chunk` / `rerender_seed` work as in the single-pass sampler.
- In the Long Video Advanced example, change Sample Chunk's seed control from `randomize` to **`fixed`** before testing resume. Enable **`save_output`** on both chunk and final Video Combine nodes to keep the videos; the example defaults to temporary previews.
- Decoding each chunk separately means each preview contains overlap context; run the collection through **Viggle Assemble Chunk Latents** → one final VAE Decode for the finished video.
- A decode/save failure leaves that chunk's latent checkpoint on disk too. Re-queue with the same `run_name` and `resume` enabled to retry previews without resampling matching chunks. Replaying previews preserves an already completed manifest if a preview fails.
- Sample Chunk generates standard noise internally from its seed; it has no noise input. Remove the old noise connection when updating a workflow. Linked model filenames are checked conservatively using file metadata across their model category; changing another file there can also invalidate reuse. Code updates invalidate automatic resume; old latent files remain readable.
- Decode/save completes before the next chunk samples. ComfyUI's execution cache may retain decoded chunks in RAM (about 0.82 GiB per 124-frame 1024×576 float32 RGB chunk). Enable Video Combine's `save_output` for durable preview videos; latent checkpoints are saved independently.

**Live loop progress:** Sample Chunk's read-only `live_progress` box updates for
every chunk, including restored chunks. No extra node or wiring is needed. Restart
ComfyUI and refresh the browser after updating. “Loop completed” excludes any
downstream final assembly/decode/save; Start, End and Assemble retain their STRING status outputs.

## Limitations

* **Identity drift on re-entry**: when the subject leaves the camera view and re-enters, the re-entry settles toward the driving video's original appearance rather than the reference image. The same applies when the subject moves far from the reference pose or makes abrupt large motions (e.g. a backflip) — the further from the still, the weaker the identity hold.
* **Lip-sync limitations**: the generated subject does not reliably lip-sync to the conditioning video.
* **Reference image compatibility**: if you cannot get the reference-image character to appear correctly in the output video (identity drift), make the reference image match the pose/stance of the person in the conditioning video as closely as possible (same background). Keep the gen between **0.4–0.6 megapixels** and use **LCM or normal sampling with 6–8 steps**. Higher resolutions have been tested reliably up to **1.2 MP**, but the driving video and reference image must then be high quality — pixelated sources will show in the output.

Viggle Chunked Sampler also has a live_progress display for sampling, cache hits and final decoding. Its chunk_map output is retained; reuse is memory-only.
